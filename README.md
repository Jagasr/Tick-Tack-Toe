# Tick-Tack-Toe

This is the game I made for my Python Essentials 1 certification from Cisco Networking Academy

Fun project for anybody who got as far as seeing this repository:

I wonder if somebody can make a better, less buggy version of this software? 

If you do manage to recreate this software to be better, I would like to know, email me! My
email is on my profile.

I have released this software under a license for it to be modifiable.
